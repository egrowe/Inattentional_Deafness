Inattentional Deafness Experiment

Draft versions of scripts required to run an auditory analogue of inattentional blindness experiments.

Task involves a visual task (letter array target search) in which participants must identify the target letter of 'X' or 'Z' when flashed on the screen for 100 ms. The letter array is comprised of 6 letters in total.

In 50% of trials a tone is played concurrently with the visual presentation screen. The tones can be of 4 different frequencies: 500, 1000, 1500 or 2000 Hz.

The experiment is comprised of 3 testing stages of around 10 minutes each (and will be run while recording MEG)

PHASE 1: Participants are not informed of the presence of tones (to the visual task)
PHASE 2: Participants are informed of presence of tones but told to ignore and do visual task
PHASE 3: Participants must respond to the visual task first, before identifying which type of tone played
